Some python snippets/example and jupyter notebooks I made over the time that 
could be useful (hopefully) to someone üòÄ.

### PyQt5
Generic QWidget and QObject.

- **pyqt_zmq_server.py**: Simple Qt objects to bridge Qt and ZMQ in the case of a request-reply pattern
(REQ/REP):

### Utilities
- **flattenable_dict.py**: Subclass of the dict class to allow a dictionary to be flattened and
unflattened as a list of lists

### Jupyter notebooks
This section is quite old, and it is far to be my best work.

- **Selection ROI.ipynb**
 the purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to simply make a Bokeh graph communicate with the Jupyter python kernel (without using the heavy framework Bokeh Server).
 
- **Hdf5.ipynb**
A simple function to extract the image data from HDF5 file generated by the STXM experiment at Synchrotron SOLEIL

## Code style

this code respect most of the PEP8 (and following) guidance, except for the line 
break at 79 (or 80) characters. The hard-break is at 120 and except for natural
or easy break before 80, the line should break inbetween 80 and 100. (because,
nobody use 12" screen anymore, come-on !). obviously, web link cannot be broke

In addition, one the major problem in coding style is to be coherent with the 
different libraries, which, for historical reasons, have different styles. It is 
clearly the case between the python and the Qt  or the Logging library for 
example. To reconcile those two worlds, It has been chosen to follow library 
guideline over the PEP8 for all related code. 

One can read the following blog explaining this choice and how to implement it : 
 - [Pyqt coding style guidelines](http://bitesofcode.blogspot.com/2011/10/pyqt-coding-style-guidelines.html)
 - [In depth coding guideline](https://bitesofcode.blogspot.com/2011/10/in-depth-coding-guidelines.html)

Finally, the comments follow  [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html) 
style and reStructuredText standard.
