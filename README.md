Some python snippets/example and jupyter notebooks I made over the time that 
could be tu use (hopefully) to someone üòÄ.

## Jupyter notebooks
This section is quite old, and it is far to be my best work.

- **Selection ROI.ipynb**
 the purpose of this code is to demonstrate how to simply make a Bokeh graph communicate with the Jupyter python kernel (without using the heavy framework Bokeh Server).
 
- **Hdf5.ipynb**
A simple function to extract the image data from HDF5 file generated by the STXM experiment at Synchrotron SOLEIL
